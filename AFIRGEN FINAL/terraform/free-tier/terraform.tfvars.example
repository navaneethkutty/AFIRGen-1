# AFIRGen Free Tier Configuration Example
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize for your deployment

# AWS Region (us-east-1 recommended for free tier)
aws_region = "us-east-1"

# Project name (used for resource naming)
project_name = "afirgen"

# Environment (should remain free-tier)
environment = "free-tier"

# Administrator IP for SSH access (REQUIRED)
# Replace with your actual IP address in CIDR notation
# To find your IP: curl ifconfig.me
# Example: "203.0.113.45/32" (the /32 means exactly this IP)
admin_ip = "YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/32"

# EC2 AMI ID (REQUIRED)
# Ubuntu 22.04 LTS AMI ID for your region
# To find the latest AMI in us-east-1:
# aws ec2 describe-images --owners 099720109477 \
#   --filters "Name=name,Values=ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*" \
#   --query 'Images[*].[ImageId,CreationDate]' --output text | sort -k2 -r | head -n1
# Example for us-east-1: "ami-0c7217cdde317cfec"
ami_id = "ami-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

# Database Configuration
# RDS endpoint will be populated after RDS instance is created
# For initial deployment, leave as placeholder
rds_endpoint = "placeholder.rds.amazonaws.com"

# Database name
db_name = "fir_db"

# Database credentials (REQUIRED - use strong passwords)
db_username = "admin"
db_password = "CHANGE_ME_TO_STRONG_PASSWORD"

# Note: Network configuration (VPC CIDR, subnet CIDRs) is fixed in variables.tf
# and should not be modified to maintain free tier architecture compliance.
