# AFIRGen Free Tier Configuration Example
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize for your deployment

# AWS Region (us-east-1 recommended for free tier)
aws_region = "us-east-1"

# Project name (used for resource naming)
project_name = "afirgen"

# Environment (should remain free-tier)
environment = "free-tier"

# Administrator IP for SSH access (REQUIRED)
# Replace with your actual IP address in CIDR notation
# To find your IP: curl ifconfig.me
# Example: "203.0.113.45/32" (the /32 means exactly this IP)
admin_ip = "YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/32"

# Note: Network configuration (VPC CIDR, subnet CIDRs) is fixed in variables.tf
# and should not be modified to maintain free tier architecture compliance.
