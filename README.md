# ⚖️ AFIRGen – AI-based FIR Generation System

AFIRGen is an AI-powered system built to automate **First Information Report (FIR)** generation using real-world Indian legal data (BNS).  
It combines **Speech-to-Text (STT)**, **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to create accurate, structured, and law-compliant FIR drafts in real time.

---

## 🧠 Overview
- Uses **Whisper** for speech-to-text and **Donut OCR** for image-to-text extraction.  
- Implements a **RAG pipeline** (with RAG model) to pull relevant BNS sections and contextual data.  
- Fine-tuned **LLaMA**, **Mistral**, and other open-weight LLMs on Indian Law and Alpaca-style datasets.  
- Integrates all components into a **modular FastAPI backend** connected to a **MySQL** database.

## 🔒 Security Features

AFIRGen implements comprehensive security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities:

- **HTTPS/TLS Encryption**: All traffic encrypted with TLS 1.2+ (see below)
- **CORS Protection**: Configurable allowed origins (no wildcards in production)
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per minute per IP (configurable)
- **Input Validation**: XSS and SQL injection prevention
- **Authentication**: Timing-attack resistant with constant-time comparison
- **Security Headers**: X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS, and more
- **File Upload Security**: Size limits, MIME validation, secure filenames
- **Session Management**: UUID-based with automatic expiration

For detailed security information, see:
- [Security Documentation](./AFIRGEN%20FINAL/SECURITY.md)
- [Security Implementation Summary](./AFIRGEN%20FINAL/SECURITY-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md)
- [Security Quick Reference](./AFIRGEN%20FINAL/SECURITY-QUICK-REFERENCE.md)

**Security Testing**: Run `python AFIRGEN\ FINAL/test_security.py` to validate security measures.

## 🔐 HTTPS/TLS Support

AFIRGen now supports HTTPS/TLS encryption for all traffic using an nginx reverse proxy:

- **TLS 1.2 and 1.3**: Modern encryption protocols only
- **Strong Cipher Suites**: Forward-secret, high-strength ciphers
- **HTTP to HTTPS Redirect**: Automatic redirect for all HTTP traffic
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, and more
- **Let's Encrypt Support**: Free, automated certificates for production
- **Self-Signed Certificates**: Easy setup for development/testing

**Quick Setup (Development)**:
```bash
cd "AFIRGEN FINAL"
./scripts/generate-certs.sh  # Select option 1 for self-signed
docker-compose up -d
# Access: https://localhost
```

**Quick Setup (Production)**:
```bash
cd "AFIRGEN FINAL"
./scripts/generate-certs.sh  # Select option 2 for Let's Encrypt
docker-compose up -d
```

For detailed HTTPS/TLS information, see:
- [HTTPS/TLS Implementation Guide](./AFIRGEN%20FINAL/HTTPS-TLS-IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- [HTTPS/TLS Quick Reference](./AFIRGEN%20FINAL/HTTPS-TLS-QUICK-REFERENCE.md)
- [HTTPS/TLS Validation Checklist](./AFIRGEN%20FINAL/HTTPS-TLS-VALIDATION-CHECKLIST.md)

**HTTPS Testing**: Run `python AFIRGEN\ FINAL/test_https_tls.py` to validate HTTPS configuration.

## ⚡ Performance & Concurrency

AFIRGen is optimized to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently:

- **Concurrent Request Handling**: Supports 10+ concurrent FIR generations
- **Connection Pooling**: HTTP/2 with persistent connections to model servers
- **Resource Management**: Semaphore-based concurrency control
- **Fast Response Times**: < 30 seconds per FIR generation
- **High Throughput**: 20-30 FIRs per minute under concurrent load

**Performance Features:**
- MySQL connection pool (15 connections)
- Shared HTTP client with connection pooling
- Parallel violation checking (70% faster)
- KB query caching with 5-minute TTL (80% faster on cache hits)
- Optimized token generation limits

For detailed performance information, see:
- [Concurrency Implementation](./AFIRGEN%20FINAL/CONCURRENCY-IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- [Concurrency Test Guide](./AFIRGEN%20FINAL/CONCURRENCY-TEST-GUIDE.md)
- [Performance Optimizations](./AFIRGEN%20FINAL/PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATIONS.md)

**Performance Testing**: 
- Single request: `python AFIRGEN\ FINAL/test_performance.py`
- Concurrent load: `python AFIRGEN\ FINAL/test_concurrency.py`

## ✅ Demo Readiness Check
Run the automated demo-readiness checker to validate stable frontend tests and static backend checks in one command:

```bash
cd "AFIRGEN FINAL"
python check_demo_readiness.py
```

This is intended for **demo confidence** (not full production certification).
